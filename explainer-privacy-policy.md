# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: November 02, 2024*

## ntroduction

"Explain with AI" is a Chrome extension designed to provide explanations of selected text using OpenAI's API. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your information.

## Data Collection and Use

"Explain with AI" does not collect personal data and does not share any personal information with third parties.

To function properly, the extension accesses and shares certain data as follows:

- **Chrome Storage API**: We use Chrome's Storage API to store the extension's configuration settings locally on your device. This includes your OpenAI API key, chosen OpenAI model, custom prompts, preferred response language, and related settings. This information is stored locally and is only shared with the OpenAI API as needed to provide the service.

- **OpenAI API**: To generate explanations for selected text, the extension communicates with the OpenAI API. The following information is shared with OpenAI:
  - The selected text.
  - The content of the entire webpage (we must do it to make OpenAI model aware about the context for the selected text).
  - Your preferred response language.
  - The selected language model.
  - Your preferred response length in words.
  This data sharing is essential to deliver accurate and context-aware explanations.
